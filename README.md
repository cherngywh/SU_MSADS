## Description

#### The Applied Data Science program at Syracuse university’s School of Information Studies is a practitioner’s degree – while the curriculum is founded upon firm theoretical underpinnings, the program is designed to be a professional program with a strong emphasis on the applications of data science to enterprise operations and processes, particularly in the areas of data capture, management, analysis and communication for decision.

## Table of Contents

### Data Management

#### Understand different types of data to build a secured database to clearly store structured data and conduct transaction. Deploy these data on a scalable and robust distributed systems like Hadoop like Data Lake to handle all types of big data. Eventually with Data Warehouse concept to perform ETL, create data sets that precisely fulfill the needs for Business Analytics.

### Business Analytics 

#### Clearly figure out the root cause, strategically plan steps and actions to improve the performance to meet the business goal with various soft tools. Profoundly understand statistics and probability theory to analyze the nature of the datasets and the tendency underlying the data to make the best business decision.

### Model & Prediction

#### To let computer act like human to complete vast tasks like classify objects, determine true or false, find out unknown pattern and the trend in the future. Train it with all popular ML and DL algorithms with fundamental knowledge to fine tune the hyperparameters to reach a decent performance

## Summary

#### The path in the program that I selected is about data engineering. I took all classes from database foundation to real world application like data warehouse as well as more hardware related field like distributed file system (Hadoop). All these classes provide me a comprehensive knowledge from physical computer infrastructure to virtual data information extraction.

#### Not to mention the core courses which are focus on machine learning and analytics, I gained abundant hands-on experience to explore data, tell a good story with statistical thinking and predict the future with the model that built by AI. I’m confident and ready to be a data scientist to work in the industry.

#### In this program, I met many wonderful people, made new friends and learned from brilliant, knowledgeable professors from various fields. It’s a wonderful journey. Go Orange!!
